Data and script from Nicotinamide mononucleotide restores impaired metabolism, endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis in old sedentary male mice, published in iScience.

Aging is accompanied by a decline in neovascularisation potential and increased susceptibility to ischemic injury. Here, we confirm the age-related impaired neovascularization following ischemic leg injury and impaired angiogenesis. The age-related deficits in angiogenesis arose primarily from diminished EC proliferation capacity, but not migration or VEGF sensitivity. Aged EC harvested from the mouse skeletal muscle displayed a pro-angiogenic gene expression phenotype, along with considerable changes in metabolic genes. Metabolomics analysis and 13C glucose tracing revealed impaired ATP production and blockade in glycolysis and TCA cycle in late passage HUVECs, which occurred at nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺)-dependent steps, along with NAD+ depletion. Supplementation with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of NAD⁺, enhances late-passage EC proliferation and sprouting angiogenesis from aged mice aortas. Taken together, our study illustrates the importance of NAD+-dependent metabolism in the maintenance of EC proliferation capacity with age, and the therapeutic potential of NAD precursors.
